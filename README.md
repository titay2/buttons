## **Approach**

### 1. Reusable Grid Component  
   - Created reusable button components and a reusable grid component to display four buttons of the required types.  
   - Added support for dynamic content in both components.  

### 2. Theming  
   - Used Angular Material's theming system to define custom colors for accent and warn to match the custom theme.  

### 3. CSS Customization  
   - Customized the button, disabled button, and focus properties using CSS.  

### 4. Type Safety  
   - Defined TypeScript interfaces (`IButtonConfig`, `ITile`) to ensure type safety and improve code readability.
